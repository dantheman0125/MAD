        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
          Doffen lives in Tanzania, in a small district called Haneti. He lives here with his 5 sisters and 3 brothers.
          He spends his days going to school, working and helping his younger siblings. Amongst all this, we asked him
          what he thought about the climate that is changing and what he meant we should do about it. He told us that he
          knows that if the world carries on like it has for many years, he will maybe be the last generation of his family
          to grow old. His contribution in the local comunity is to remove the plastic waste that is building up along the roads
          to his school. He uses some of the plastic to store water in, or to fashion tools his family might need for gardening.
          The rest goes to a recycling plant that Redd Barna has stationed around areas like Haneti.
