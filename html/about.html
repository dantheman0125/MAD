      <h1>About The Project</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Our idea to help the children getting heard, 
        is to send a representative from Redd Barna to 
        villages collecting different opinions, videos, 
        and quotes weekly. This information will be posted 
        on this webpage dedicated to share the children’s 
        opinions about climate change. To promote the webpage, 
        we have taken inspiration from the marketing techniques
        of Fyre Festival. This consists of creating a hype 
        around a QR-code with a countdown. Fyre festival had
        celebrities and influencers share a blank, bright 
        orange photo without any other information to it, 
        mystifying the whole project. This made a lot of people
        question the photo and what the reason behind the photo was, 
        causing a major viral hype. The reason why we have chosen 
        to use this advertisement, is to get a lot of people talking 
        about “what’s going to happen when the timer reaches zero?”.
        <br>
        As stated above, we want to get the unheard voices of the children
        out to the public. We belive that in this way, if we can hear what the
        smallest victims are experiencing every day, we can make a difference!
        They also have great insight and new takes on the matter that we haven't even
        considered. If you feel moved by their stories, and want to help them, 
        you can do that by donating to this cause directly here on this site.
        Either way, there is much you can learn simply by reading their powerful
        stories!</p>
